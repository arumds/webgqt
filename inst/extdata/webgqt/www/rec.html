<p><b>Description: </b>Recessive module filters for such variants where the affected individual (Phenotype=2) has a homozygous state and the parents are heterozygous carriers (Phenotype=3) and unaffected individuals from the general population (Phenotype=1) are reference for the alternate allele. Ideally, recessive module requires the genomes of both the parents to infer recessively inherited variants. However, in the absence of one of the parents the module still infers the possible recessively inherited variants based on the single parent genotypes.In the absence of both the parents, the user can switch to case-specific module to filter for the homozygous variants specific to the affected individual while the other unaffected individuals (Phenotype=1) from the general population are used as controls.</p>

<b>Parameters: </b>
<p><b>Maximum number of cases allowed to have missing genotype: </b>The user can chose the number of affected individuals that can have missing genotype.</p>
<p><b>Maximum MAF in controls: </b>Inaddition, the user can adjust the criteria by allowing the variant to be present in controls by providing maximum minor allele frequency of the variants in the control cohort.</p>


<b>Required columns in PED file:</b><br>
<p><b>IndividualID</b> and <b>Phenotype</b> columns are required in pedigree analysis and case-control modules.</p>

<b>Phenotype coding:</b><br>
0 : exclude from the analysis<br>
1 : unaffected individuals (controls)<br>
2 : affected off-springs (cases)<br>
3 : carrier parents <br></p>
