<p><b>Description: </b> This module filters for compound heterozygous variants at single variant level to provide potential compound heterozygous variants for further downstream analysis at gene level. This filters for such variants where the affected individual (Phenotype=2) is heterozygous for the variant and also one parent is heterozygous while the other parent is wild type for the variant. Both the parents should be coded as Phenotype=3 in this module.  This module fits only when the genetype data is available for the off-spring and both the parents.The individuals in the control group (Phenotype =1) can be used to filter out common variants.</p>

<b>Parameters: </b>
<p><b>Maximum number of cases allowed to have missing genotype: </b>The user can chose the number of affected individuals that can have missing genotype.</p>
<p><b>Maximum MAF in controls: </b>Inaddition, the user can relax the criteria by allowing the variant to be present in controls by providing maximum minor allele frequency of the variants in the control cohort.</p>


<b>Required columns in PED file:</b><br>
<p><b>IndividualID</b> and <b>Phenotype</b> columns are required in pedigree analysis and case-control modules.</p>

<b>Phenotype coding:</b><br>
0 : exclude from the analysis<br>
1 : unaffected individuals (controls)<br>
2 : affected off-springs (cases)<br>
3 : parents <br></p>
