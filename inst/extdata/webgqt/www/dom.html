<p><b>Description: </b>Dominant module filters for such variants where the affected individual (Phenotype=2) and the affected parent (Phenotype=3) are  heterozygous for the variant and the unaffected parent and/or individuals (Phenotype=1) are wild type for the alternate allele. In this module the affected parent must be present in the PED file  and coded as Phenotype=3. If available, the unaffected parent should be coded as control, Phenotype=1. </p>

<p>In the absence of affected parent, the user can switch to case-specific module to filter for the heterozygous variants specific to the affected individual (Phenotype=2) while the other unaffected individuals (Phenotype=1) from the general population are used as controls.</p>

<b>Parameters: </b>
<p><b>Maximum number of cases allowed to have missing genotype: </b>The user can chose the number of affected individuals that can have missing genotype.</p>
<p><b>Maximum MAF in controls: </b>Inaddition, the user can relax the criteria by allowing the variant to be present in controls by providing maximum minor allele frequency of the variants in the control cohort.</p>

<b>Required columns in PED file:</b><br>
<p><b>IndividualID</b> and <b>Phenotype</b> columns are required to perform pedigree and case-control analysis</p>

<b>Phenotype coding:</b><br>
0 : exclude from the analysis<br>
1 : unaffected parent and/or unaffected individuals (controls)<br>
2 : affected off-spring (cases)  <br>
3 : affected parent <br></p>
