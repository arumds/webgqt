<b>Individual count module</b>

<p> This module allows to find population specific variants by individual count. This module filters the variants at differential percentage of individuals between two populations defined in the PED file. Briefly, the user could filter variants of specific genotype that are shared by atleast X percentage of individuals in Population1.
These variants are further compared to the Population2 i.e. filters for those varaints of a specific genotype which are present at a user specified maximum percentage of individuals in Population2</p>
<p><b> Select Population1: </b> Population names to be chosen as Population1. Multiple population names can be selected.</p>
<p><b>Chose Gender: </b> Enter the gender of the population to be queried.</p>
<p><b>Minimum MAF: </b> Enter the minimum minor allele frequency of the variants in population1 to be retrieved.</p>

<p><b> Select Population2: </b> Population names to be chosen as Population2. Multiple population names can be selected.</p>        
<p><b>Chose Gender: </b> Enter the gender of the population to be queried.</p>
<p><b>Maximum MAF: </b> Enter the maximum minor allele frequency of the variants in population2.</p>

<b>Required columns in PED file:</b><br>
<p> <b>IndividualID</b>, <b>Population</b> and <b>Gender</b> fields are mandatory for population module while other optional fields can be present. Gender could be coded as male/female or 1 for males and 2 for females and NA if unavailable.</p>
