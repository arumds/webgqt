<p>For the 1000G phase 3 demo data, individuals HG00096,HG00097 are chosen as cases/affected (Phenotype=2) and HG00099 as carrier (Phenotype=3) and the remaining samples as controls (Phenotype=1).</p>

<b>Instructions for preparing custom PED file</b>

<p>webGQT requires a phenotype file in PED format that that describes the samples in the target VCF/BCF file.
The ped file must contain tab separated fields of IndividualID,Phenotype,Gender,Population
to perform pedigree analysis, case-control studies and population comparisons.</p>

<b>Example PED format:</b></br>
<p>IndividualID   Population  Gender   Phenotype<br>
HG00096	GBR	1	2<br>
HG00097	GBR	2	2<br>
HG00099	GBR	2	3<br>
HG00100	GBR	2	1<br>
HG00101	GBR	1	1<br>
HG00102	GBR	2	0<br></p>

<b>Phenotype coding:</b><br>
0 : exclude from the analysis<br>
1 : unaffected individuals (controls)<br>
2 : affected off-spring (cases) or affected parents<br>
3 : carrier parents<br></p>

<b>Gender coding:</b><br>

<p>Gender could be coded as male/female or 1 for males and 2 for females. Gender could be NA if unavailable.</p>

<b>Required columns for pedigree analysis and case-control analysis modules:</b><br>

<p><b>IndividualID</b> and <b>Phenotype</b> columns are required to perform pedigree and case-control analysis</p>

<b>Required columns for population analysis module:</b><br>

<p><b>IndividualID</b>, <b>Population</b> and <b>Gender</b> are required in the PED file to perform population based variant filtering,
and can have optional columns like Phenotype etc. IndividualID, Population and Gender information in the input PED file
is dynamically populated in the population analysis module parameters.</p>
