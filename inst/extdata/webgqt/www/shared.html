<p><b>Description: </b> This module filters the variants that are shared in the cases (affected individuals, Phenotype=2). This does not filter the variants against the unaffected individuals.</p>

<b>Parameters: </b>
<p><b>Chose Genotype: </b>The user can chose the genotype of the variants: HET (heterozygous), HOM_ALT (homozygous alternate) or HET HOM_ALT (heterozygous and homozygous) from the dropdown list.</p>
<p><b>Minimum cases to have the genotype: </b>To rescue the missing genotypes, user can specify the minimum number of cases to have the selected genotype.</p>
<p><b>Maximum MAF in controls: </b>Inaddition, the user can relax the criteria by allowing the variant to be present in controls by providing maximum minor allele frequency of the variants in the control cohort.</p>

<b>Required columns in PED file:</b><br>
<p>IndividualID and Phenotype columns are required in pedigree analysis and case-control modules.</p>
