<p><b>Description: </b>This module identifies the mutations that are completely absent in the parents (Phenotype=3) and occur as novel heterozygous mutations in the off-springs (Phenotype=2) and wildtype in unaffected individuals (Phenotype=1).</p>

<b>Parameters: </b>
<p><b>Maximum number of cases allowed to have missing genotype: </b>The user can chose the number of affected individuals that can have missing genotype.</p>
<p><b>Maximum MAF in controls: </b>Inaddition, the user can relax the criteria by allowing the variant to be present in controls by providing maximum minor allele frequency of the variants in the control cohort.</p>

<b>Required columns in PED file:</b><br>
<p><b>IndividualID</b> and <b>Phenotype</b> columns are required to perform pedigree and case-control analysis</p>

<b>Phenotype coding:</b><br>
0 : exclude from the analysis<br>
1 : unaffected individuals (controls)<br>
2 : affected off-spring (cases)<br></p>
