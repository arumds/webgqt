<p><b>Description: </b> This module filters the variants that are specific to the affected individuals (Phenotype=2) i.e. the variants that are present only in the affected individual and absent in the unaffected individuals(Phenotype=1).</p>

<b>Parameters: </b>
<p><b>Maximum number of cases allowed to have missing genotype: </b>Quiet often sequencing errors could lead to missing genotypes in some samples. To rescue candidate variants among missing genotypes, the user can chose the number of affected individuals that can have missing genotype.</p>
<p><b>Chose Genotype: </b>The user can chose the genotype of the variants: HET (heterozygous), HOM_ALT (homozygous alternate) or HET HOM_ALT (heterozygous and homozygous) from the dropdown list.</p>

<b>Required columns in PED file:</b><br>
<p>IndividualID and Phenotype columns are required in pedigree analysis and case-control modules.</p>
