<p><b>Case-specific module: </b> Case-control module allows to filter variants among big cohort of samples classified into cases and controls in the phenotype file.</p>
<p><b>Population module: </b>This module filters the variants between samples of two populations and specific genders defined in the PED file.</p> 
<p><b>Sample module: </b>This module can be used to retrieve variants present in specific samples. The sample names can be selected from the dynamically populated dropdown list from the IndividualID field defined in the PED file.</p>
<p><b>Results: </b>webGQT outputs the filtered variants in each module in tabular and standard VCF format. The VCF format output can be used for further downstream analysis with external programs eg: bcftools. Inaddition, variant summary table and a histogram is generated using the gene annotations in the input VCF file.</p>
