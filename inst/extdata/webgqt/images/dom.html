<p><b>Description: </b>Dominant module filters for such variants where the affected parent (Phenotype=3) and the affected individual (Phenotype=2) is heterozygous for the variant and unaffected individuals (Phenotype=1) are wild type for the alternate allele. In the absence of affected parent, the user can switch to case-specific module to filter for the heterozygous variants specific to the affected individual while the other unaffected individuals (Phenotype=1) are used as controls.</p>

<b>Parameters: </b>
<p><b>Maximum number of cases allowed to have missing genotype: </b>The user can chose the number of affected individuals that can have missing genotype.</p>
<p><b>Maximum MAF in controls: </b>Inaddition, the user can relax the criteria by allowing the variant to be present in controls by providing maximum minor allele frequency of the variants in the control cohort.</p>

<b>Required columns in PED file:</b><br>
<p>IndividualID and Phenotype columns are required to perform pedigree and case-control analysis</p>

<b>Phenotype coding:</b><br>
0 exclude from the analysis<br>
1 unaffected parent or off-spring or other unaffected individuals (controls)<br>
2 affected off-spring (cases)<br>
3 affected or carrier parent<br></p>
